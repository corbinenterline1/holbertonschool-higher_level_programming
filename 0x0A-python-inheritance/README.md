 # 0x0A - Python - Inheritance
Task # | Short Description
-------|------------
[Task 0](0-lookup.py) | Returns the list of available attributes & methods of an object.
[Task 1](1-my_list.py) | Class `MyList` that inherits from parent/superclass `list` a public instance method `print_sorted`.
[Task 1 Test](tests/1-my_list.txt) | Test file for 1.
[Task 2](2-is_same_class.py) | Returns `True` if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class; otherwise `False`.
[Task 3](3-is_kind_of_class.py) | Returns `True` if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class; otherwise `False`.
[Task 4](4-inherits_from.py) | Returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class; otherwise `False`.
[Task 5](5-base_geometry.py) | Empty class `BaseGeometry`.
[Task 6](6-base_geometry.py) | Class `BaseGeometry` with public instance method `def area(self)`.
[Task 7](7-base_geometry.py) | Class `BaseGeometry` with another p;ublic instance method `def integer_validator(self, name, value)`.
[Task 7 Test](tests/7-base_geometry.txt) | Test file for 7.
[Task 8](8-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry`.
[Task 9](9-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` a couple public instance methods.
[Task 10](10-square.py) | Class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`.
[Task 11](11-square.py) | Class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` a couple public instance methods.
