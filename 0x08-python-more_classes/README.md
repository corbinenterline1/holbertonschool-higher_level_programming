Task # | Short Description
-------|------------
[Task 0](0-rectangle.py) | Empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
[Task 1](1-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with private attributes `width` and `height`.
[Task 2](2-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with public instance methods `area` and `perimeter`.
[Task 3](3-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with some exceptions handled, plus setters for `width` and `height`.
[Task 4](4-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with getters for `width` and `height`, plus extras.
[Task 5](5-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with a printed message when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted.
[Task 6](6-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with public class attribute `number_of_instances`.
[Task 7](7-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with public class attribute `print_symbol`, initialized to `#`
[Task 8](8-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with static method `bigger_or_equal` to compare areas of instances of `Rectangle`.
[Task 9](9-rectangle.py) | Class `Rectangle` with a class method `square` that returns a new rectangle with `width == height == size`
